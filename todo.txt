Things to maybe do sometime...
- Remove debug printouts
- clean/refactor
- exit button from game
- dynamic upload of pictures/sounds
- load games from github (url)
- Look for any language dependencies (like return/play-again)
- make a help page with pedagocical information/links
- the fullscreen return icon does not look ok in certain screen sizes
- consider to maybe disable screen saver (if possible)
