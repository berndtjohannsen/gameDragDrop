# Small kids game. Learn to read by word-image association. 

## Description
This is a simple web game where the player using drag and drop matches text-boxes with pictures. The game can be customized with for example pictures of family, friends, pets etc. See the file config.txt. The current "games" are in Swedish but there is no language dependency per se. The game is more or less completely written by Cursor, so if the code looks messy, don't blame me. It will not run well in mobile browsers (due to screen size issue).
