## Description
This is a simple web game where the player uses drag and drop to match text-boxes with pictures. The game can be customized with for example pictures of family, friends, pets etc. See the file config.txt. The current "games" are in Swedish but there is no language dependency per se. The code is more or less completely written by Cursor, so if it looks messy, don't blame me. It will not run well in all mobile browsers due to screen size issue.  



Example, screen-shot:
